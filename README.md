# C-PROGRAMMING
* C is a general-purpose programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs.
* C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.

## Why Learn C?

* It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world
* If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar
* C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python
* C is very versatile; it can be used in both applications and technologies

## Requirements C

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using gcc 4.8.4
* All your files should end with a new line
